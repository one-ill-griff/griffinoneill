# Hi, I'm Griffin

I'm a Computer Science major who loves building things — especially mobile apps, data tools, and tech that supports fitness and environmental sustainability. I  work best when I'm creating software that helps people understand themselves, their performance, or the world around them.

### What I'm working on
- **FitLog**, a mobile fitness tracker app built in Android/Java
- A **data analysis/visualization project** (Python + pandas + matplotlib)  
- A **cloud microservice** deployed with AWS/GCP  
- A **GIS mini-project** exploring environmental/geo datasets

### What I'm Learning
- Cloud deployment (AWS Lambda, GCP Cloud Functions)  
- Data visualization + dashboards  
- GIS tools (GeoPandas, QGIS, Folium)

### Tech I use
- **Languages:** Java, Python, C++, JavaScript, SQL, HTML/CSS,
- **Mobile:** Android Studio, Java, XML
- **Data:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- **Cloud:** Firebase, AWS (learning), GCP (learning)  
- **Other:** Git/GitHub, Linux, REST APIs

### Interests
- Fitness tech  
- Environmental data & sustainability  
- Mapping & GIS  
- Clean UI/UX  
- Building useful tools
